# Project 2

The goal of this project is to understand the idea of threads, by implementing a basic <br />
user-level thread library for Linux. The library will provide a complete interface for <br />
applications to create and run independent threads concurrently.<br />

Some Requirements are:<br />

Create new threads<br />
Schedule the execution of threads in a round-robin fashion<br />
Provide a synchronization mechanism for threads to join other threads<br />
Be preemptive, that is to provide an interrupt-based scheduler<br />

## Phase: 1

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
