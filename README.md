# Project 2

The goal of this project is to understand the idea of threads, by implementing a basic <br />
user-level thread library for Linux. The library will provide a complete interface for <br />
applications to create and run independent threads concurrently.<br />

Some Requirements are:<br />

Create new threads<br />
Schedule the execution of threads in a round-robin fashion<br />
Provide a synchronization mechanism for threads to join other threads<br />
Be preemptive, that is to provide an interrupt-based scheduler<br />

## Phase: 1 | Queue Implementation

Queue functions are <br />


## Phase: 2 | Thread Control Block (TCB) Implementation 

uthread_create() <br />
uthread_yield() <br />
uthread_start() <br />
uthread_block() <br />
uthread_unblock() <br />
uthread_exit() <br />


## Phase: 3 | uthread_join() Implementation 

uthread_join()

## Phase: 4
